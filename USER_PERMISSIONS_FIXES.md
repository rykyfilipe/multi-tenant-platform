# User Permissions System - Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Permission Management Issues

**Problem**: The permission management system had several critical issues:
- API endpoint used `canUseAdvancedFeatures` but hooks checked `canManagePermissions`
- Hardcoded user IDs and tenant IDs in permission creation
- Missing proper error handling in the UI
- Inconsistent permission checking between components

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Added `canManagePermissions` to plan constants for all plans
- ✅ Updated API endpoint to use correct permission check (`canManagePermissions`)
- ✅ Fixed hardcoded values in permission creation hooks to use proper context values
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling in permissions page
- ✅ Improved error states and user feedback

### 2. Delete User Functionality Issues

**Problem**: Delete user functionality had issues:
- Missing confirmation dialogs
- Complex deletion logic that could cause issues
- Not using the transaction manager for safe deletions

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Added confirmation dialog with user name before deletion
- ✅ Improved delete user API to use transaction manager for safe deletions
- ✅ Better error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Maintained existing logic for admin vs regular user deletions

### 3. General System Improvements

**Problem**: Various inconsistencies and missing features:
- Inconsistent permission checking
- Missing proper error states
- Hardcoded values throughout the system

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Standardized permission checking across all components
- ✅ Added proper error states and loading states
- ✅ Replaced all hardcoded values with proper context values
- ✅ Improved user experience with better feedback
